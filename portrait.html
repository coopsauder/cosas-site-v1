              <br>

              <p><b>How many jobs did you apply for before you landed your first Co-op placement?</b></p>
              <p>I applied for around 25 jobs before landing, but it felt like 1000! </p>
              <br>
              <p><b>How has the Co-op team helped you?</b></p>
              <p>From Conny tolerating me bothering her way more times than could ever be necessary (and always being patient), to Lynne connecting me with other Co-op students working with companies I was interested in, to Nicole and Mursal finding the BC Tech job posting and literally standing in front of me convincing me that it was a perfect fit, everyone on the Co-op team has been an amazing help. In case you were wondering, Nicole and Mursal were right – BC Tech is full of extremely passionate individuals who exactly when to put on their serious thinking hats, and when it’s time for an Earnest Ice Cream break.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p><b>What are your biggest tips for newly admitted Co-op students?</b></p>
              <li> Keep an open mind when applying for jobs – you’re likely in Co-op because you want to gain experience, try to new things, and maybe just find your passion (or two). Remember that to do those things, you may need to step out of the Sauder-made divisions of specializations. If I had continued only pursuing OpLog-specific jobs, I may never have gained my newfound love for tech and the #startuplife.</li>
              <li> Whether you’re nervous about job-hunting, you have an interview coming up that you want help preparing for, or anything in between, make an appointment with the Co-op office. Mock interviews aren’t as awkward as they may seem, and can be extremely helpful. The Co-op team is there to help you succeed – don’t ever feel like you can’t go to them!</li>

              <p><b>How many jobs did you apply for before you landed your first Co-op placement?</b></p>
              <p>7 </p>
              <br>
              <p><b>How has the Co-op team helped you?</b></p>
              <p>I visited the Co-op team often during the application phase to get resume/ CL touch ups as well as interviewing tips. I even visited career coaches for the smallest things such as how to phrase a follow up email. They made my job hunting process a lot smoother!
              </p>
              <br>
              <p><b>What is your biggest accomplishment in Co-op?</b></p>
              <p> Acquiring 26 new accounts for the PepsiCo Foods Team. I traveled the lower mainland pitching the Snacks To You program to small business owners. At the end of my project, I was glad I met so many interesting customers who are just as excited about Pepsi products as I am!
              </p>
              <br>
              <p><b>What is the best part of the Co-op program?</b></p>
              <p>It provides you with the chance to try out different career paths and test the waters. By structuring work terms to be either 4 or 8 months, you really can experience different companies and industries without any commitment. The program allows us to find the right career that really caters to our interests and strengths.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p><b>Future plans after graduation??</b></p>
              <p>TBD! Hopefully Co-op will help me figure it out. 
              </p>
              <br>
              <p><b>What are your biggest tips for newly admitted Co-op students?</b></p>
              <p>Don’t be scared to apply for positions you feel that you’re not qualified for. You never know what opportunities are available to you. And don’t get discouraged if your first few applications don’t go the way you planned. It’s all part of the learning process and it’ll only get easier.

              <p><b>How many jobs did you apply for before you landed your first Co-op placement?</b></p>
              <p>Around 30 applications and around 8 interviews – I may be the worst interviewee in all of Co-op.</p>
              <br>
              <p><b>How has the Co-op team helped you?</b></p>
              <li>The Co-op team has helped greatly with the job hunt: resume, cover letter, interview, network.</li>
              <li>The Co-op team provided critical emotional support through the endless application grind.</li>

              <br>
              <p><b>What is your biggest accomplishment in Co-op?</b></p>
              <p> Playing a key role in redesigning and implementing a method of capturing customer data and feedback for Hootsuite. This contributed to automating the process as well as increasing a company KPI (Early NPS Score) by gathering more valuable information.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p><b>What is the best part of the Co-op program?</b></p>
              <li>It helps with figuring out what type of work, culture, and balance you desire most.</li>
              <li>It’s sometimes easier to enter competitive companies as a Co-op student.</li>
              <li>Delays your graduation and the inevitable quarter life crisis that follows after graduating and facing eternal full time.</li>
              <br>
              <p><b>Future plans after graduation??</b></p>
              <p>Find a job that makes me happy while making me a solid living, be challenged while being comfortable at work, fall in love, get married, have two kids, buy a house, retire doing the things I love. As you can see I’m pretty lost – hopefully Co-op will help. 
              </p>

              <p><b>What are your biggest tips for newly admitted Co-op students?</b></p>
              <p>APPLY EARLY because interviews and offers are handed out often before the deadline.

              <p>After being integrated into the Co-op program, I am able to see the benefits first-hand. Having the opportunity to explore a future career path in an industry before committing full-time provides students with the opportunity to really understand what they want to do in the future.

              <h2 class="text-center">Business and Computer Science | Class of 2018</h2>
              <p><b>Work Term Employer(s):</b> General Dynamics, SAP</p>
             
              <br>

              <p><b>How many jobs did you apply for before you landed your first Co-op placement?</b></p>
              <p>Approximately 30.</p>
              <br>
              <p><b>How has the Co-op team helped you?</b></p>
              <p>After helping you figure out your professional goals, values, and skills, the team points you in the right direction with information about ideal careers, be it in the form of info sessions, mentorship programs, or other related events. The co-op team also provides opportunities to strengthen your resume/cover letter and prepare for interviews, ultimately making you a more confident applicant.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p><b>What is your biggest accomplishment in Co-op?</b></p>
              <p>I programmed 8 features in two software version releases for the Aurora CP-140, a military plane currently deployed by the Canadian Armed Forces. I would speak more about them but it’s classified.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p><b>What is the best part of the Co-op program?</b></p>
              <p>For me, I’m still not entirely sure what it is exactly that I want to do. The tech industry has an overabundance of specialized positions and responsibilities that it’s difficult to pinpoint a specific role that I would see myself doing for the next five years. Co-op has given me the opportunity to explore these specialized roles both explicitly through the job postings, and through the position at GD I’ve held as a software engineer, where coding was only one of many responsibilities I’ve had.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p><b>Future plans after graduation??</b></p>
              <p>Once I’m sure I’ve gotten my foot in the door, I plan to take a really, really long vacation.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p><b>What are your biggest tips for newly admitted Co-op students?</b></p>
              <p>Apply early. You don’t want your interviews to conflict with your midterm schedule.
              </p>

              <p><b>1. What coop position(s) did you do during your time in university?</b></p>
              <p>Date: 2012
                <br> Company: Worldwide Relocation Services
                <br> Position: Business Writer
                <br>
                <br> Date: 2013
                <br> Company: Government of Canada - Department of Natural Resources
                <br> Position: Economist
                <br>

              </p>
              <br>
              <p><b>2.  What 3 things would you recommend to graduating class for Sauder?</b></p>
              <li>Try and figure out what you are going to do before you graduate. A lot of the applications for jobs and gradute schools are due at the start of your final year. Don't miss the deadlines or you will have to wait another year to reapply.</li>
              <li>Get to know at least 3 people you can use for references. If you want to get into graduate school, you will need 3 recommendation letters from professors in your field. You often need good marks and good references to make it into a good
                graduate school.
              </li>
              <li>Use co-op to try as many things as possible. It is only short term, so you are not committed to anything. Varied work experience opens up a lot of opportunities; but a strong education opens up even more.
              </li>
              <br>
              <p><b>3.  What source of resources (books, articles, movies, etc.), would you recommend to students seeking to go into your field?</b></p>
              <p>Ask your program advisors for recommendations on which programs or schools might be the best fit for you. Toronto is the top school in Canada for Mathematics, but I may be a bit biased in my opinion. If you are curious at how much math there
                is in finance, take a look at "Stochastic Calculus for Finance II" by Shreve or any other advanced financial math text.
              </p>
              <br>
              <h2 class="text-center">Academia Specific</h2>
              <p><b>1.  What made you decide to go into the field of Academia?</b></p>
              <p>a) There is a lot left to learn, but even more waiting to be discovered. Ever wonder where the Black Scholes formula comes from? You will finally build the background in stochastic calculus necessary to be able to understand the models used
                to price derivative securities.
                <br> b) You only have one chance at it. As soon as you take a break from school, it will be impossible to get back into the rhythm.
                <br> c) If you really like the subject, it does not feel like work at all. You are literally getting paid to do your hobby.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p><b>2.  Could you identify some pros and cons to your profession? </b></p>
              <p>Pros: You are getting paid to improve yourself. You also have complete freedom - everything is done at your own pace and you get to choose what you want to study.
                <br>Cons: It is a huge time commitment - a Master's Degree can take 1-2 years and a PhD takes another 4 years. You will be working on solving a problem for 4 years of your life, so make sure it is something you really enjoy.

              </p>
              <br>
              <p><b>3. What relevant clubs or electives would you recommend to students entering into your field?</b></p>
              <p>Nothing really. There is a big gap between undergraduate research and graduate research so graduate schools don't weigh extracurricular activities too heavily. At the very least, you should have taken some graduate level courses so you know
                if the material is interesting to you. I took MATH 418, 419, 420 and 421 at UBC.
              </p>

              <p>My personal website and papers will be available on the University of Toronto Math Department Website eventually. You can reach me at justin.p.ko@gmail.com in the meantime.
                <br> I am a first year PhD student at the University of Toronto. I am interested in problems related to applied probability in fields such as statistical mechanics, computational complexity, finance, and massive data analysis.

              <p><b>2.  What 3 things would you recommend to graduating class for Sauder?</b></p>
              The best advice that I can give to anyone is just be yourself. How are you going to stand out. First try to figure that out. What is it in you. How are you going to bring a value to the company. How are you going to grab your employer's attention. Regardless
              of whatever it is, you should be wanting to learn. Really reflect what are the skillsets that you have. Reflect on what you are good what you are not good at.
              <br>
              <br>
              <p><b>3.  What source of resources (books, articles, movies, etc.), would you recommend to students seeking to go into your field?</b></p>
              <p>I suggest really staying up to date in the digital marketing field. I would read 1 article a day. How is the Facebook algorithms changing. Really stay up to date in digital marketing. For instance you should be able to answer questions like:
                "What is your favorite social channel and why are you interested in it?"
              </p>
              <br>

              <h2 class="text-center">Marketing Specific</h2>
              <p><b>1.  Could you identify some pros and cons to your past coop workterm?</b></p>
              <p>Speak Easy - The company focused a lot on its culture and core values. Strong sense of culture and team work. Board room. Only social media
                <br> Marketing Zen Group - Everything was done on Slack because it was remote. Skype or Room. Two different experiences. Broad experiences. Influential marketing.

                <br>They are two different experiences. I do like the flexibility of having to manage your own time by working remotely, but sometimes i like to be around people. So it is hard to identify exact pros and cons of my work experience, since they
                are interchangeable in many ways.
              </p>
              <br>
              <p><b>2. What relevant clubs or electives would you recommend to students entering into your field?</b></p>
              <p>
                I never took a digital marketing course. In terms of experience, try to have as many opportunities as possible. I was part of the UBC Imprint in 2015. We did alot of team work. I was also able to learn how to use Mailchimp. Really taking that approach.
                Whatever opportunity out there, take it. Really learn more about digital marketing overall. There's no correct way to be successful. Be yourself.
