              <p><b>2.  What 3 things would you recommend to graduating class for Sauder?</b></p>
              <li>Make meaningful friendships that are as diverse as possible while at UBC, these people will be your network</li>
              <li>Try out different internships, volunteer positions, and coop jobs to find out what you enjoy doing and don't enjoy doing</li>
              <li>Every job will have its ups and downs. Find something that is interesting to you most of the time, and don't forget to keep up with your hobbies outside of work</li>
              <br>
              <p><b>3.  What source of resources (books, articles, movies, etc.), would you recommend to students seeking to go into your field?</b></p>
              <p>Google all the basic questions you have - you may find books and articles that others have recommended. The main thing is to talk to lots of people in those fields.
Feel free to reach out to me by email or on LinkedIn if you have any questions. </p>

<h2 class ="text-center">Finance Specific</h2>
<p><b>1.  What made you decide to go into the field of Finance?</b></p>
<p>I ended up going into the Management Consulting field instead of Finance. I tried Finance co-ops but realized I loved interactions with people more than interactions with numbers. Management Consulting appealed to me because it's a good balance between helping people and practicing some technical skills. 
</p>

<p><b>2.  Could you identify some pros and cons to your profession? </b></p>
<p>Pros: Work with an amazing and smart team everyday to help others solve problems. You also get to see all sorts of industries and organizations and learn what they do.
<br>Cons: Unpredictability of work-life balance. Some days are regular hours while other days you might need to hit a tough deadline. 
</p>

<p><b>3. What relevant clubs or electives would you recommend to students entering into your field?</b></p>
<p>Get into a leadership role in any club, class or job. You need to be able to work with all types of people. Public speaking and facilitation skills are necessary as well.

              <p><b>1. What coop position(s) did you do during your time in university?</b></p>
              <p>Date: 2012<br>
Company: Worldwide Relocation Services<br>

</p>
              <p><b>2.  What 3 things would you recommend to graduating class for Sauder?</b></p>
              <li>Try and figure out what you are going to do before you graduate. A lot of the applications for jobs and gradute schools are due at the start of your final year. Don't miss the deadlines or you will have to wait another year to reapply.</li>
              <li>Get to know at least 3 people you can use for references. If you want to get into graduate school, you will need 3 recommendation letters from professors in your field. You often need good marks and good references to make it into a good graduate school. 
</li>
              <li>Use co-op to try as many things as possible. It is only short term, so you are not committed to anything. Varied work experience opens up a lot of opportunities; but a strong education opens up even more. 
</li>
              <br>
              <p><b>3.  What source of resources (books, articles, movies, etc.), would you recommend to students seeking to go into your field?</b></p>
              <p>Ask your program advisors for recommendations on which programs or schools might be the best fit for you. Toronto is the top school in Canada for Mathematics, but I may be a bit biased in my opinion. If you are curious at how much math there is in finance, take a look at "Stochastic Calculus for Finance II" by Shreve or any other advanced financial math text. 
 </p>

<h2 class ="text-center">Academia Specific</h2>
<p><b>1.  What made you decide to go into the field of Academia?</b></p>
<p>a) There is a lot left to learn, but even more waiting to be discovered. Ever wonder where the Black Scholes formula comes from? You will finally build the background in stochastic calculus necessary to be able to understand the models used to price derivative securities. <br>
b) You only have one chance at it. As soon as you take a break from school, it will be impossible to get back into the rhythm. <br>
c) If you really like the subject, it does not feel like work at all. You are literally getting paid to do your hobby.
</p>

<p><b>2.  Could you identify some pros and cons to your profession? </b></p>
<p>Pros: You are getting paid to improve yourself. You also have complete freedom - everything is done at your own pace and you get to choose what you want to study. 
<br>Cons: It is a huge time commitment - a Master's Degree can take 1-2 years and a PhD takes another 4 years. You will be working on solving a problem for 4 years of your life, so make sure it is something you really enjoy. 

</p>

<p><b>3. What relevant clubs or electives would you recommend to students entering into your field?</b></p>
<p>Nothing really. There is a big gap between undergraduate research and graduate research so graduate schools don't weigh extracurricular activities too heavily. At the very least, you should have taken some graduate level courses so you know if the material is interesting to you. I took MATH 418, 419, 420 and 421 at UBC. 
</p>

<h2 class ="text-center">Comments and Notes</h2>
<p>My personal website and papers will be available on the University of Toronto Math Department Website eventually. You can reach me at justin.p.ko@gmail.com in the meantime.<br>
I am a first year PhD student at the University of Toronto. I am interested in problems related to applied probability in fields such as statistical mechanics, computational complexity, finance, and massive data analysis.
